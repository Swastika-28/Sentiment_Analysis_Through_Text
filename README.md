# Sentiment_Analysis_Through_Text

This project is a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system that classifies text input into one of seven emotions, going beyond traditional positive, negative, and neutral categories. It leverages a combination of NLP techniques and deep learning to accurately detect and visualize emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.

Features
Multi-Class Emotion Detection: Classifies text into seven distinct emotion labels.

Real-time Analysis: Processes user-provided text input and provides an immediate emotional output.

Data Visualization: Generates a graph to show the distribution of emotions within the dataset.

Emoji Integration: Displays a relevant emoji with the final output for an intuitive user experience.

Interactive Interface: A web-based application built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilized for text processing and feature extraction.

PyTorch: A deep learning framework used for building and training the emotion classification model.

Scikit-Learn: Employed for traditional machine learning models and data preprocessing.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A key library for tokenization and text normalization.

Streamlit: Used to create the user-friendly, interactive web application.

Neattext: A library for text cleaning and preprocessing.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-repo.git
cd your-project-repo
Install the required libraries:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed.

Run the Streamlit application from your terminal:

Bash

streamlit run app.py
The application will open in your web browser. Enter any text into the input box to see its emotional analysis.

Dataset
[Provide a link to the dataset you used here, and a brief description of it, e.g., "The model was trained on the [Dataset Name], which contains thousands of labeled text samples across seven different emotion categories."]

Model Training
[Briefly describe your model training process, e.g., "A deep neural network was built using PyTorch and trained on the pre-processed text data. The model was fine-tuned to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between the seven emotion classes."]
